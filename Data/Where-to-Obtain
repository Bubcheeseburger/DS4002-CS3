## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the **USDA FoodData Central** [Download Datasets page](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets).  
We specifically used the **Branded Foods** data release (April 2025).  

Two CSV files were incorporated into our analysis:  
- `food.csv` — general food reference information  
- `branded_food.csv` — detailed branded food product data  

These files provide standardized ingredient lists and metadata, which we preprocess and analyze to classify meals as healthy or unhealthy.
